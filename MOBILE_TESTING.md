## Expected Touch Target Sizes

### Current Implementation (Verified)

| Element | Size | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Score cards (sets-based) | Full flex-1 height (250px+) | ✅ Exceeds standard |
| +1/+2/+3 buttons (goals) | 56px × auto | ✅ Exceeds standard |
| Cricket run buttons | 56px × 56px | ✅ Exceeds standard |
| Navigation links | 44px × auto | ✅ Meets standard |
| Bottom bar buttons | 44px × auto | ✅ Meets standard |
| Undo button | 44px × 44px | ✅ Meets standard |

**WCAG 2.1 AA Requirement:** 44px × 44px minimum

---

## Device-Specific Considerations

### iOS Safari
- **Viewport height quirks:** Address bar show/hide changes viewport height
- **100vh issue:** Use `-webkit-fill-available` if needed
- **Private mode:** localStorage works (iOS 14+)
- **Haptic feedback:** Requires System Haptics enabled
- **Touch delay:** 300ms delay removed with `touchAction: 'manipulation'`

### Android Chrome
- **Back button:** Must handle navigation stack correctly
- **Status bar:** Fullscreen apps hide status bar
- **Haptic feedback:** navigator.vibrate() widely supported
- **Touch events:** Passive touch listeners for better scroll performance

### Samsung Internet
- **Compatibility:** Generally same as Chrome
- **Extensions:** Some users have ad blockers
- **Dark mode:** Respects system dark mode setting

### iPad
- **Pointer support:** App should work with mouse/trackpad
- **Split screen:** Test at 50% and 33% widths
- **Landscape:** Primary orientation for tablets
